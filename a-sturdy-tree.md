# The Insider's Arsenal: Beacon Bonanza Repository
This repo only scratches the surface of the potential risks posed by an insider leveraging an access control violation script. The associated GitHub repository provides a comprehensive understanding of frame types, subtypes, and their hexadecimal values across various IEEE 802.11 standards.


While the script sturdy-palm-tree.txt captures Wi-Fi beacon frames, it's essential to note that the act of capturing beacon frames itself doesn't necessarily imply an access control violation. Beacon frames are a standard part of Wi-Fi communication and are broadcasted by access points to announce their presence and provide information about the network.

However, the misuse or manipulation of beacon frames by an insider threat could potentially lead to access control violations. For example, an insider might use captured beacon frames to gain insights into the Wi-Fi network, identify active access points, and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or perform unauthorized actions.

Stay vigilant, be aware, and explore the Beacon Bonanza repository to fortify your defenses against insider threats in the dynamic world of Wi-Fi security. In the next era of cyber threats, knowledge is power, and understanding Defense in Depth is your shield.

Keep your networks secure, and may your Wi-Fi signals be ever vigilant against the Beacon Bonanza unleashed by insider threats!
