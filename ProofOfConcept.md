This post dives into the covert world of insider threats, focusing on the intricate dance between multivector keystroke injection attacks, the strategic setup of cronjobs for access control violations, and the often-overlooked danger posed by probe frames. Together, these elements create a silent and persistent threat that can elude traditional security measures.

Multivector Keystroke Injection Attacks:
Insiders with malicious intent employ multivector keystroke injection attacks, sophisticated techniques that manipulate and inject malicious commands across multiple vectors. This strategic approach allows insiders to sidestep conventional security measures, capturing sensitive information and executing unauthorized actions. Leveraging various entry points, including compromised endpoints and internal systems, insiders can move undetected within the organization, wielding this method as a potent tool in their  arsenal.
Setting Up Cronjobs for Access Control Violations: misuse cron jobs to execute actions that violate access controls
For insiders seeking prolonged access and persistence, cronjobs become a key instrument. By exploiting access control mechanisms, insiders can schedule unauthorized tasks through cronjobs in Unix-like operating systems. This method enables them to establish a lasting foothold on compromised systems, evading detection and increasing the complexity of identifying their presence.
The Pivot: Achieving Long-Term Persistence:
Insider threats go beyond initial compromise; they aim for enduring persistence within an organization's network. The pivotal tools in achieving this persistence are multivector keystroke injection attacks and cronjobs. By skillfully combining these techniques, insiders can navigate through the network, escalate privileges, and maintain unauthorized access. This creates a sustained threat that challenges traditional security measures, often slipping under the radar.
Stealthy Threat of Probe Frames and EAPOL Filtering Risks:

Amplifying the tactics of insider threats, probe frames emerge as a subtle peril. Widely employed in Wi-Fi networks for device discovery, these frames can be wielded by insiders to not only capture sensitive information but also to intercept crucial 4-way handshakes, such as those containing EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN). By exploiting probe frames, insiders can compromise the security of encrypted connections, paving the way for unauthorized access, escalation of privileges, and prolonged persistence within the network. When coupled with the intricate techniques of multivector injection and cronjobs, the utilization of probe frames adds a layer of complexity to detection, emphasizing the intricate and nuanced nature of insider threats. However, the risks escalate further with the potential filtering of EAPOL frames, allowing insiders to target specific authentication exchanges and exploit vulnerabilities, ultimately posing a severe threat to network security.

Objective:
Demonstrate the potential risks associated with an insider leveraging multivector keystroke injection attacks and setting up cronjobs for access control violations to achieve persistent access and takeover.
Test Setup:
Power on Flipper Zero and navigate to badusb/probe_dump.
On the target machine, open a terminal window.
Connect Flipper to the target machine and click "Run" on the device.
Note: Sudo privileges must be gained beforehand for script execution.
Test Execution:
Wait until Flipper reads 100%.
Disconnect Flipper Zero.
Download the pcap file from Discord and open it in Wireshark.
Analyze the Wireshark capture for …………………..
Script Details (probe_dump.txt):
# Script for macOS targets using Flipper badusb
# Key steps in the script:
1. Create a directory with a timestamp in /tmp.
2. Save a script to capture probe request frames in the created directory.
   Save a script to send 	simulating the broadcasting of beacon frames
3. Set up a cron job to run the script at reboot for persistent access.
4. Execute passwordless sudo tcpdump for capturing Wi-Fi traffic.
5. Send the captured data to Discord via webhook.
6. Capture Wi-Fi traffic continuously for 1 minute, then repeat.
# Note: Sensitive details like gaining sudo access and modifying sudoers file are intentionally omitted.
# Note on Scapy Script for Beacon Frames: The Python script utilizes Scapy, a powerful packet manipulation library, to craft and send Wi-Fi beacon frames. This script aims to simulate the broadcasting of beacon frames, typically employed by legitimate Wi-Fi access points. It forms part of the broader proof of concept involving the execution of cron jobs and the capture of probe requests for multivector injection attacks. The loop_count parameter specifies the number of frames to be sent in the loop, and it has been adjusted for this specific use case.
